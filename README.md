# Predicting MLB Batter On-base-percentage

### Introduction
Welcome to my personal tribute to Moneyball by Michael Lewis. In this notebook, I will apply the power of Python to predict every MLB player's on-base percentages in the 2021 season. Using the obp.csv file as the dataset, I aim to create a predictive model that takes into account a player's plate appearances and on-base percentages in previous seasons to accurately forecast their on-base percentage for the 2021 season (which already happened). Finally, I will compare those predictions to the actual values and see just how accurate the models are.
### Approach:
- Prepare the data and variables of interest in various ways and test multiple machine learning regression models.
- Evaluate the models and choose the best-performing estimator based off its performance metrics.
- Make the 2021 OBP predictions and see how they compare to the actual 2021 on-base-percentages.
### Learnings:
Baseball is random! Though career statistics are useful estimators of possible outcomes, it's far from a guarentee that reality will conform to inductive reasoning. Regardless, data and statistics still play a large role in front office strategy. As a baseball romantic, I wanted to give my best rendition as if I were being assigned a task by Billy Beane. Nowadays, the game has changed and finding arbitrage requires significantly more complex modeling. In the future I will experiment with advanced Statcast data and see what I can cook up.
