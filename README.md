# Predicting-MLB-batter-on-base-percentage
Kyle Rudman

Introduction
Welcome to my personal tribute to Moneyball (2011) starring Brad Pitt. In this notebook, I will apply the power of Python to predict every MLB player's on-base percentages in the 2021 season. Using the obp.csv file as the dataset, I aim to create a predictive model that takes into account a player's plate appearances and on-base percentages in previous seasons to accurately forecast their on-base percentage for the 2021 season (which already happened). Finally, I will compare those predictions to the actual values and see just how accurate the models are.

My approach to this problem will be as follows:
- Prepare the data and variables of interest in various ways and test multiple machine learning regression models.
- Evaluate the models and choose the best-performing estimator based off its performance metrics.
- Make the 2021 OBP predictions and see how they compare to the actual 2021 on-base-percentages.
